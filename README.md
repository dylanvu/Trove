# Trove

### About
Trove is a modern bookmarking application with group sharing features. Trove aims to change the way we bookmark websites. Typically, we bookmark websites with the outdated bookmarking functionality built into modern day browsers. However, traditional browser bookmarks don't provide a lot of visual context or sorting capabilities. This makes it harder for users to search through their bookmarks as their collection grows bigger. Bookmarks should be easy to search and filter through. Trove also aims to make sharing bookmarks easier through group sharing features.

### Features
- Trove allows users to bookmark any website via a chrome extension or submitting a URL in the web application.
- Bookmarks are presented as elegant cards to users, adding visual context that isn't provided in traditional bookmarks.
- Users can create and share lists of bookmarks with other users.

Users can currently:
- Add bookmarks via an input field within the Trove web application
- Create lists to organize bookmarks.
- View bookmarks

Future Development includes adding functionality listed below:
- Search and filter bookmarks
- Add tags to bookmarks to make searching and filtering easier
- Move bookmarks to a different list via drag and drop
